            <h2>Bodybuilding Meal Plan: What to Eat, What to Avoid</h2>
            <p>Bodybuilding is centered around building your body’s muscles through weightlifting and nutrition.</p>
            <p>Whether recreational or competitive, bodybuilding is often referred to as a lifestyle, as it involves both the time you spend in and outside the gym.</p>
            <p>In order to maximize your results from the gym, you must focus on your diet, as eating the wrong foods can be detrimental to your bodybuilding goals.</p>
            <p>This article explains what to eat and avoid on a bodybuilding diet and provides a one-week sample menu.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>Bodybuilding Basics</h2>
            <p>Bodybuilding differs from powerlifting or Olympic lifting in that it’s judged on a competitor’s physical appearance rather than physical strength.

As such, bodybuilders aspire to develop and maintain a well-balanced, lean and muscular physique.

                    To do this, many bodybuilders start with an off-season followed by an in-season way of eating — referred to as a bulking and cutting phase, respectively.</p>
                <br />
                <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>
Bodybuilding training and dieting is typically divided into two phases: bulking and cutting. The goal of the bulking phase is to build muscle, whereas the cutting phase is dedicated to preserving muscle while losing body fat.</p>
